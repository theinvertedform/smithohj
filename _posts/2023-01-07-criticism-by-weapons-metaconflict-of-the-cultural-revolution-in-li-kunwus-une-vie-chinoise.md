I invite you to read my article published in Concordia's [Journal of Political Affairs. ](https://issuu.com/jpauselections2020/docs/journalfinal4) It concerns the representation of the Cultural Revolution. I hope this can contribute to a better understanding of this unique time in Chinese history and world history. Li Kunwu's work is important because it points towards an understanding of this events as a civil war and presents western audiences with a perspective which they very seldom hear.
